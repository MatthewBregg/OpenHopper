This is a fairly basic dump of the STL files containing the current state of the project.

Many of these files contain several parts with should be split into individual parts and printed separately.

For example, the trigger grip file, the main grip, and grip plates should be printed as one piece, while all else should be printed individually.

ATM there is no build guide, but one is coming.

Basically I wouldn't reccomend printing this yet, but I am putting the files out there.

The hopper + hopper tube could be a valuable base for any other hopper fed blaster.

My current plan
- Prototype and dump files <- I am here
- Add main power switch to stock
- Add optional flashlight/bottom grip plate thingy
- I want to fine tune groove fillers a little bit
- Add a pattern for a flexible ball gate into the opper lid.
- Sling attachment point
- Greebles
- Final print with good filament, and infill. During this process, document and write up a build guide.

STATUS: In progress. I am currently printing parts, and writing this guide live as I go.

* Materials 
- 6x2mm bullet connectors, male and female pairs.
- 3X 3mm ID 6mm (3x6x2.5mm MR63ZZ) OD bearings.
- 2x Cherry DC1 microswitch.
- Pololu 530RPM 37D gearmotor.

* Printing Time
I advise printing in PETG for all parts, PLA is untested, although would probably be fine, most parts on this blaster are fairly thick.

Supports were avoided for the majority of the model, there's 1-2 places that do need supports, mainly 
- Both of the spinners.
  - Supports around the perimeter for these are very easy to remove, and not visible anyway, so extra residue can be ignored. See their section for more details.
- The sling mount on the stock mount.
  - This broke off very cleanly and easily with my pliers.

I advise using ironing for pretty much all parts, although it's purely optional/cosmetic.

For the most part, any reasonably strong infill/perim/solid combo will work, so feel free to diverge from the recommended if you so desire *EXCEPT* when I mention that a part needs to be extra solid/100% infill.

Assume .20mm layer height unless specified otherwise.

** The Hopper
*** File: Angled Hopper.stl
#+CAPTION: The angled hopper plated in the correct orientation.
[[./angled_hopper_plated.png]]

No supports.
Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

This is the main hopper that holds the balls. 
Plate as shown. This isn't a particularly load bearing part, and even in my prototype prints with 10% cubic infill, and only 2 perimeters, it feels fairly solid.
Nonetheless, no kill like overkill.

*** File: Plain Lid No speed loader.stl/New Lid with space for feed gate.stl
#+CAPTION: The lid plated in the correct orientation. Print one or the other.
[[./hopper_lids.png]]

No supports.
Ironing.
30% hex infill, 4 perims, *2* solids (might as well take advantage of that clear petg here!).
I used variable layer height for the retainer on the speed gate variation, but this is optional.

*** File: HopperToFlywheelTube.stl
The meat of the blaster.

This connects the hopper top, flywheel cage, stock, and grip assembly together.
This also houses the ESCs, both spinner motor mounts, and has most of the wire raceways.

*NOTE: Captive nuts, make sure to insert a print pause at the right point to catch em!*

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

20% gyroid infill, 4 perims/5 solids, for my own sanity in print times.

No supports needed.

*** File: Wings.stl
This serves as the hopper agitator.

Supports on build plate only, due to the nature of it they are easy to remove, and final surface doesn't matter too much, this part goes inside the hopper.

Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

*** File: Spinner.stl

This serves the pusher, and feeds balls in the feed neck into the flywheels.

Supports on build plate only, due to the nature of it they are easy to remove, and final surface doesn't matter too much, as the support side isn't visible.
No Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

You'll need to insert a nyloc nut while printing this, so make sure to add a pause at 18.2m to do so. 
The dome side of the nyloc nut should be pointing down towards the build plate.

*** File: Spinner Motor Cover.stl

This acts as cover for the spinner in the feed neck, which otherwise would have it's motor terminals and endbell exposed.  It also doubles as a wire raceway for said motor wires.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

No supports needed.

** Stock
*** File: Stock Mounter.stl
This connects the feed neck, hopper, main grip plate to the stock.

We print this one at 100% infill due to this.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing here.

Supports are needed for the sling mount, see the support image. They are minor, and easily break off even with petg with some simple pliers.

#+CAPTION: With supports
[[./stock_mounter_supports.png]]

*** File: Outer stock.stl

No supports, no ironing.

20% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

This is mostly cosmetic, but it does house the power switch.  

#+CAPTION: Orientation
[[./stock_outer.png]]

*** File: stock_inner.stl

No supports, no ironing.  4 perims/5 solids.

I used a height range modifier to set everything above 159mm to 100% infill, although this is optional. 

#+CAPTION: Height range modifier
[[./stock_inner_height_mod.png]]

This serves as the battery box, and connects the stock outer to the blaster.

Warning: Do not print over octoprint, slic3r generates lots of short lines/arcs, to the point where my printer started going at a snails pace and ruined the print. This might just be an issue for 8 bit printers, due to the speed of checksumming serial gcode commands.

** The FWC
*** File: FWC.stl
The flywheel cage, the big spinny wheel mount. 

4 perims/5 solids, 100% rectilinear infill. 
Yes to ironing.  No supports.

100% infill to reduce noise and ensure there's no flex.

Print out two of these!

*** FWC Cover.stl

This serves several purposes
- Reinforce the connection between the FWC and main blaster.
- Serve as a finger guard for the top of the flywheels.
- Contains the hop up mount. 
- Contains wire raceways and a compartment for the main blaster controller.
- The blaster controller compartment lid doubles as the top rail.

Despite this, printing it is fairly straight forward, and I don't feel the need to make this particularly strong (100% infill or more perimeters). 

Even if you slung the blaster primarily via the rail here, I wouldn't be too worried, although in that case I might beef up the print parameters. 

20% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.
No supports/ironing.

#+CAPTION: Orientation

*** Controller Compartment Lid With Rail.stl or Controller Compartment Lid.stl

30% honeycomb infill, 5 perims/4 solids.

This is the controller cover, and the picatinny rail. If you'd prefer not to have a picatinny rail, just print the plain cover instead. 

Supports no, ironing yes.

* Step 0: Immediate post processing
** Cosmetic Gluing (Optional)
I'm not going to go into too much detail on this as these are purely optional cosmetic greebles. 
Print them out, ideally with a color change midway so they look nicer, and devcon them into the debossed areas in the FWC cover and the FWC. 

Print out the Orb Weaver Sign A and B, and glue them to the FWC cover.stl. 

Note that both files are identical. 

In extras, print out the spidey_logo_disks. Note you will need to use a .25m nozzle for the details to resolve well. Enabling thin line detection in your slic3r produces ok results for a .4mm nozzle.
The disk to the left in the stl file goes to the left side of the FWC. 

** Drilling out holes

I decided not to drill out holes this time.
Mainly as I realized that drilling out holes with a square nut insert could easily leave some debris in the insert channel and make life much more difficult.
With the diameter I used for the holes (3.2mm), I found drilling mostly unneeded, so decided to just not drill any holes, with the below exceptions 

*** FWC
- Drill out the holes for the flywheel motors with a 3 mm bit.
  [[./fwc_step_0.jpg]]
  [[./fwc_step_0_1.png]]
*** Flywheels
- Drill out the center hole with a 13/64 drill bit.
  [[./fw_step_0_0.jpg]]
  [[./fw_step_0_1.jpg]]
  
** Nuts
Get your hex nuts and square nuts ready, as now comes the +painful+ fun part.
There's two main types of nut inserts we are using here (aside from the captive nuts inserted during the print phase).

*Inserting square nuts*: Get a flat head and just press them in. They friction fit into place quite nicely. 
[[./square_nut_flathead.jpg]]

*Screw Pulling Technique (AKA, inserting hex nuts)*: Borrowing from PRUSA, most of the hex nuts will be inserted with this method. See 
https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/1-introduction_54032 for a guide to screw pulling nuts.



* Step 1: Flywheel Cage Assembly
Remember to have drilled out the flywheel center hole (13/64 bit), and flywheel motor mount holes (3mm bit) before starting this.

** Step 1.1: Inserting the nuts
6 square nuts, 2 hex nuts need to be inserted.
The hex nut inserts are in the front of the cage, directly adjacent to the front square nut inserts by the barrel exit. 
Use the screw pulling technique here.
[[./fwc_assembly_1_1.jpg]]

** Step 1.2: Attaching the motors to the flywheels.
Solder 2MM Bullet connectors onto the flywheel motor leads.
[[./motor_bullet_connectors.jpg]]
Pay attention to the flywheel motor mount interference tabs. 
[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_0.png]]

They line up with the indents in the motor. 

[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_1.png]]

Insert the motor, ensuring that it is nearly flat with the flywheel bottom. A bit less than a mm will stick up. If the tabs aren't aligned, rotate and try again.
Avoid putting force on the motor endbell.
[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_3.jpg]]

Remembering to avoid putting force on the motor endbell, add the nyloc top nut, and torque down.
A 5/16 ratchet wrench worked perfectly for me.
[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_3.jpg]]

Repeat for the remaining flywheel.

** Step 1.3: Insert the flywheels into the cage.
Prepare 8 M3x8 screws.

Place the wire leads from the motors though the raceway in the fwc channel. 
[[./fwc_assembly_1_3_0.jpg]]

Insert the flywheel into the cage. 
[[./fwc_assembly_1_3_1.jpg]]

Use 4 M3x8 screws to tighten the motor to the cage. Screw said screws in diagonal pairs.

Repeat for the other wheel. 

** Finished Result

[[./fwc_assembly_finished.jpg]]

Ensure both wheels spin freely with minimal if any interference.

If interference occurs, lightly sand away the source. 

In my case, the groove fillers and wheels printed cleanly enough that there was barely any interference, and I did not need to sand. 

A good test is if the wheels can be spun freely and actually spin, instead of getting caught before completely a full rotation.

* Step 2: Assembling the feedneck core
** Step 2.1: Sand the inside of the feedneck.
Get rid of any bridging artifacts.
[[./2_1_sanding_bridge.jpg]]



** Step 2.2: Insert the hex nuts into the 6 holes.

These are too deep to screw pull, so instead I'd advise
- Using a longish screw to wedge the nut a bit into the hole.
[[./2_2_0.jpg]]
- Using a larger hex driver + hammer to force it all the way down.
[[./2_2_2.jpg]]
- Then screw pulling from the top.
[[./2_2_1.jpg]]

** Step 2.3: Insert the roller bearing

Get a  bearing (MR63ZZ). 

Insert the bearing into the bearing hole.
[[./2_3_0.jpg]]

Use the same technique as screw pulling a hex nut to pull the bearing into place. Note that you will need a hex nut and a pair of pliers to hold the hex nut for this to work. 
Do not overtighten the screw, you can damage the bearing.
[[./2_3_1.jpg]]

** Step 2.4: Insert the roller.
Get an M3x14 screw.
Insert the roller into the roller area, making sure the nub sticking up fits into the other side of the bearing cavity.
[[./2_4_0.jpg]]
Proceed to insert the M3x14 screw through the bearing, and into the roller.
Tighten down, but again, do not overtighten. 
[[./2_4_1.png]]

Once snug, back off 1/2 turn.
The roller should be able to spin fairly free with a good flick. 

** Step 2.5: The cycle switch.
 Get a Cherry DC1 ready, and cut the arm down to 10mm.
[[./2_5_0.jpg]]

Get a pair of M2x20 screws ready. 

Drop the screws into the feedneck, as shown.
[[./2_5_1.jpg]]
Tighten them until they just start poking into the switch area. 

[[./2_5_2.jpg]]

Feed the switch wires through the raceway as shown, and then position the cycle switch into it's slow.  Ensure the button on the switch is towards the hopper side, and not towards you.

Tighten the M2x20 screws until snug, do not overtighten and strip.

End result should look like
[[./2_5_3.jpg]]

Oh, then go ahead and use something (like a flathead screwdriver) to push the switch wiring through one of the raceways, and into the ESC comppartment.
[[./2_8_0.jpg]]
** Step 2.6: Nut inserts
Insert 3 square nuts into the feed neck.
[[./2_6_0.png]]
The one in the ESC housing is a PITA to get to, I used a screwdriver to slide it along the wall until it was over the slow, and a second screwdriver to get it in.

** Step 2.7: Attach the pusher/roller motor

Get the 530 RPM 37D gearmotor. 

Line up it's D shaft with the D shaft of the oller, and then press fit them.
Support the roller, and motor can while doing so. 
[[./2_7_0.jpg]]

Get an M3x6, and using a ball driver, screw the motor in. 
[[./2_7_1.jpg]]


Get some 18AWG wire, and fish it through the spinner motor cover.
[[./2_7_2.jpg]]

Proceed to then solder those wires onto the roller motor.

[[./2_7_3.jpg]]

Then fish the other end of the wires through the ESC compartment.

[[./2_7_4.jpg]]
Proceed to snap fit the motor cover onto the roller motor.
[[./2_7_5.jpg]]


Get a M3x55 screw.
Screw the motor cover to the feedneck, making sure to pull any slacking wire through as you do so.
[[./2_7_6.jpg]]


The end result should look like
[[./2_7_7.jpg]]



* Step 3: Connect the FWC Cover to the FWC
Get a pair of M3x25mm screws.

Insert them into the indicated spots 
[[./3_0_0.png]]

Tighten down.

* Step 4: Combine the FWC and Feedneck
Using the M3 bit, drill out these 4 holes, for easier screwing in later.
[[./4_0_0.png]]

Get 4 M3x40mm screws. 
Insert the flywheel motor wires into the feedneck raceway.

[[4_0_1.jpg]]

Continue to pull them taught until the FWC and feedneck are touching. 
[[4_0_2.jpg]]

Now from the back of the feedneck, use the M3x40mm screws to connect the two pieces.

Ensure no flywheel motor wires are pinched. 

[[./4_0_3.png]]

Repeat for the FWC cover, with a pair of M3x12 screws.
[[./4_0_4.jpg]]


* Step 5: Grip Assembly
** Step 5.1: The trigger.
Get a screw with ~20mm of unthreaded rod, and a total length of 28mm.

Using the M3 bit, drill out the trigger.

[[./5_1_0.jpg]]

Slide the trigger into the grip assembly, and then screw it into place.

[[./5_1_1.jpg]]

** Step 5.2: Nut inserts
(Note I did this after installing the switch, which was a mistake).

[[./5_2_0.png]]

Insert the two square nuts into the insert channel, and push them into place.
You can verify they are seated by simply looking down the screw hole.

Note there's also 4 holes for a pair of zip tie channels for wire management. Those wound up being an unused artifact in this build.
If you wanted to run wires along the entire grip, they would be useful to ensure said wires steer clear of the trigger.

Two more insert square nuts are needed.
[[./5_2_1.jpg]]

The final two insert square nuts.
[[./5_2_2.jpg]]

But wait there's more!

There's a hex nut that needs to be pulled into place too.
[[./5_2_3.png]]

[[./5_2_4.jpg]]


** Step 5.3: Install the trigger switch
You will need a pair of M2x15 screws for this.
This is simple enough. Put the wires though the top. 
Line the switch up, adjusting until you are happy with the trigger pull.
Insert M2 nuts on the other side, and then screw down into position.

[[./5_3_0.jpg]]
[[./5_3_1.jpg]]

Give the trigger some test pulls, and adjust if desired.

** Step 5.4: Install the trigger guard

[[./5_4_0.jpg]]

Prepare an M3x20 screw, and a M3x8 screw.
Line the trigger guard up, and screw it into the top of the grip plate first. 
Use the M3x20 to screw the trigger guard to the grip plate, into the hex nut that was inserted earlier. 

See item 1. on the screenshot.

Then insert the M3x8 screw into the trigger switch cavity, and gently screw it in. This serves more as an alignment peg than a screw, so don't expect it to be tight.

[[./5_4_1.png]]

** Step 5.5: Install the side grip panels.

Almost done with the grip!

Get 4 M3x12 screws ready.

Place the side panels on the blaster, and use those screws to screw both side panels into place.

[[./5_5_0.jpg]]

Pretty simple, and you've now got a fun clicky trigger grip to play with!

STATUS: In progress. I am currently printing parts, and writing this guide live as I go.

* Printing Time
I advise printing in PETG for all parts, PLA is untested, although would probably be fine, most parts on this blaster are fairly thick.

Supports were avoided for the majority of the model, there's 1-2 places that do need supports, mainly 
- Both of the spinners.
  - Supports around the perimeter for these are very easy to remove, and not visible anyway, so extra residue can be ignored. See their section for more details.
- The sling mount on the stock mount.
  - This broke off very cleanly and easily with my pliers.

I advise using ironing for pretty much all parts, although it's purely optional/cosmetic.

For the most part, any reasonably strong infill/perim/solid combo will work, so feel free to diverge from the recommended if you so desire *EXCEPT* when I mention that a part needs to be extra solid/100% infill.

Assume .20mm layer height unless specified otherwise.

** The Hopper
*** File: Angled Hopper.stl
#+CAPTION: The angled hopper plated in the correct orientation.
[[./angled_hopper_plated.png]]

No supports.
Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

This is the main hopper that holds the balls. 
Plate as shown. This isn't a particularly load bearing part, and even in my prototype prints with 10% cubic infill, and only 2 perimeters, it feels fairly solid.
Nonetheless, no kill like overkill.

*** File: Plain Lid No speed loader.stl/New Lid with space for feed gate.stl
#+CAPTION: The lid plated in the correct orientation. Print one or the other.
[[./hopper_lids.png]]

No supports.
Ironing.
30% hex infill, 4 perims, *2* solids (might as well take advantage of that clear petg here!).
I used variable layer height for the retainer on the speed gate variation, but this is optional.

*** File: HopperToFlywheelTube.stl
The meat of the blaster.

This connects the hopper top, flywheel cage, stock, and grip assembly together.
This also houses the ESCs, both spinner motor mounts, and has most of the wire raceways.

*NOTE: Captive nuts, make sure to insert a print pause at the right point to catch em!*

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

20% gyroid infill, 4 perims/5 solids, for my own sanity in print times.

No supports needed.

*** File: Spinner Motor Cover.stl

This acts as cover for the spinner in the feed neck, which otherwise would have it's motor terminals and endbell exposed.  It also doubles as a wire raceway for said motor wires.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

No supports needed.

** Stock
*** File: Stock Mounter.stl
This connects the feed neck, hopper, main grip plate to the stock.

We print this one at 100% infill due to this.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing here.

Supports are needed for the sling mount, see the support image. They are minor, and easily break off even with petg with some simple pliers.

*** File: Outer stock.stl

No supports, no ironing.

20% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

This is mostly cosmetic, but it does house the power switch.

*** File: stock_inner.stl

No supports, no ironing.  4 perims/5 solids.

This serves as the battery box, and connects the stock outer to the blaster.

** The FWC
*** File: FWC.stl
The flywheel cage, the big spinny wheel mount. 

4 perims/5 solids, 100% rectilinear infill. 
Yes to ironing.  No supports.

100% infill to reduce noise and ensure there's no flex.

*** File: Flywheel.stl
The big spinny thing.

.1mm layer height.
20% infill, honeycomb. 
No supports/ironing.
3 shells, 6 tops/6 bottoms, seam position random. 

#+CAPTION: Orientation

Print out two of these!

** Grip
*** File: Grip Sides.stl and Grip Sides(Mirror).stl
Side panels which go on the grip.
Covers the trigger wiring compartment, and improves ergonomics.

No supports, yes ironing.

25% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

*** File: Trigger Grip Assembly

The main handle.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No supports, no ironing.

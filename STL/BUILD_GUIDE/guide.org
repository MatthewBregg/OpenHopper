** Consumables
- Lengths of silicone stranded wire, 18 AWG, 16 AWG, 14 AWG, and 24 AWG.
- 6x2mm bullet connectors, male and female pairs.
- 3.5mm bullet connectors, 6x female, 2x male.
- 3X 3mm ID 6mm (3x6x2.5mm MR63ZZ) OD bearings.
- 2x Cherry DC1 microswitch with non roller levers.
- [[https://www.pololu.com/product/4741][Pololu 530RPM 37D gearmotor]].
- [[https://www.pololu.com/product/4744][Pololu 150RPM 37D gearmotor.]]
- 2 M2x20 screws, I used pan phillips drive ones.
- 2 M2x15 screws, drive/head type doesn't really matter.
- Main power switch: Bulgin/ C1300AABBEN602A, Digikey Part #: 1091-1013-ND
- A pair of brushless ESCs running simonk w/ flyshot.
  - See [[http://torukmakto4.blogspot.com/2021/01/flashing-ztw-spiders-for-flyshot.html][here]] for one way to get them. This covers flashing and prepping the ESCs for this build. A 30A ZTW Spider will work perfectly. a 40A will be a tighter fit but should work.
- 4x 7.8mm diameter, 3mm thick magnets
- M3 screws, hex socket cap. < 3mm head height, < 6mm head diameter.
- M3 hex nuts, M3 nyloc hex nut, M3 square nuts.
  - Both of the hex nuts are standard M3 hex nuts. Thickness isn't too important, although mine are 2.2 mm thick. The square nuts are the thin kind, the same ones PRUSA sends with their printers (huh, I wonder why I happened to choose those, almost like I had them lying around already...). McMaster is one of the few places I've found that sells good quality ones for a reasonable price/shipping. Other places I've found are from a slow boat to China during COVID, extremely expensive, not stainless, or require a bulk order of hundreds. https://www.mcmaster.com/square-nuts/stainless-steel-square-nuts/. Remember to get the thin ones, 5.5x1.8mm.
- Lots of 1.75 PETG filament.
- PCB and electronics (See the PCB section for details of what components you will need). 
  - Or a willingness to recreate my PCB on perfboard :).
    - Or a willingness to create an entirely new schematic and firmware for whatever driving configuration you want!
- 2x [[https://www.getfpv.com/t-motor-f80-pro-2200kv-motor.html][T-Motor F80 PRO - 2200KV.]]
- M3 thumbscrew.

    
** Tools
- A 2.5mm ball driver for M3 screws 
- Soldering station and soldering supplies.
- Dremel w/ zip disk for cutting things to size. 
- Drill with M3 bit, and 13/64 bit.
- A 3D printer.


* Printing Time
I advise printing in PETG for all parts, PLA is untested, although would probably be fine, most parts on this blaster are fairly thick.

Supports were avoided for the majority of the model, there's 1-2 places that do need supports, mainly 
- Both of the spinners.
  - Supports around the perimeter for these are very easy to remove, and not visible anyway, so extra residue can be ignored. See their section for more details.
- The sling mount on the stock mount.
  - This broke off very cleanly and easily with my pliers.

I advise using ironing for pretty much all parts, although it's purely optional/cosmetic.

For the most part, any reasonably strong infill/perim/solid combo will work, so feel free to diverge from the recommended if you so desire *EXCEPT* when I mention that a part needs to be extra solid/100% infill.

Assume .20mm layer height unless specified otherwise.

** The Hopper
*** File: Angled Hopper.stl
#+CAPTION: The angled hopper plated in the correct orientation.
[[./angled_hopper_plated.png]]

No supports.
Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

This is the main hopper that holds the balls. 
Plate as shown. This isn't a particularly load bearing part, and even in my prototype prints with 10% cubic infill, and only 2 perimeters, it feels fairly solid.
Nonetheless, no kill like overkill.

*** File: Plain Lid No speed loader.stl/New Lid with space for feed gate.stl
#+CAPTION: The lid plated in the correct orientation. Print one or the other.

30% hex infill, 4 perims, *2* solids (might as well take advantage of that clear petg here!).
I used variable layer height for the retainer on the speed gate variation, but this is optional.

*** File: HopperToFlywheelTube.stl
The meat of the blaster.

This connects the hopper top, flywheel cage, stock, and grip assembly together.
This also houses the ESCs, both spinner motor mounts, and has most of the wire raceways.

*NOTE: Captive nuts, make sure to insert a print pause at the right point to catch em!*

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

20% gyroid infill, 4 perims/5 solids, for my own sanity in print times.

No supports needed.

Supports on build plate only, due to the nature of it they are easy to remove, and final surface doesn't matter too much, as the support side isn't visible.
No Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

You'll need to insert a nyloc nut while printing this, so make sure to add a pause at 18.2m to do so. 
The dome side of the nyloc nut should be pointing down towards the build plate.

*** File: Spinner Motor Cover.stl

This acts as cover for the spinner in the feed neck, which otherwise would have it's motor terminals and endbell exposed.  It also doubles as a wire raceway for said motor wires.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

No supports needed.

** Stock
*** File: Stock Mounter.stl
This connects the feed neck, hopper, main grip plate to the stock.

We print this one at 100% infill due to this.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing here.

Supports are needed for the sling mount, see the support image. They are minor, and easily break off even with petg with some simple pliers.

*** File: Outer stock.stl

No supports, no ironing.

20% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

This is mostly cosmetic, but it does house the power switch.  

#+CAPTION: Orientation
[[./stock_outer.png]]

*** File: stock_inner.stl

No supports, no ironing.  4 perims/5 solids.

I used a height range modifier to set everything above 159mm to 100% infill, although this is optional. 

#+CAPTION: Height range modifier
[[./stock_inner_height_mod.png]]

This serves as the battery box, and connects the stock outer to the blaster.

Warning: Do not print over octoprint, slic3r generates lots of short lines/arcs, to the point where my printer started going at a snails pace and ruined the print. This might just be an issue for 8 bit printers, due to the speed of checksumming serial gcode commands.

Print out two of these!

*** FWC Cover.stl

This serves several purposes
- Reinforce the connection between the FWC and main blaster.
- Serve as a finger guard for the top of the flywheels.
- Contains the hop up mount. 
- Contains wire raceways and a compartment for the main blaster controller.
- The blaster controller compartment lid doubles as the top rail.

Despite this, printing it is fairly straight forward, and I don't feel the need to make this particularly strong (100% infill or more perimeters). 

Even if you slung the blaster primarily via the rail here, I wouldn't be too worried, although in that case I might beef up the print parameters. 

20% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

* Step 0: Immediate post processing
** Cosmetic Gluing (Optional)
I'm not going to go into too much detail on this as these are purely optional cosmetic greebles. 
Print them out, ideally with a color change midway so they look nicer, and devcon them into the debossed areas in the FWC cover and the FWC. 

Print out the Orb Weaver Sign A and B, and glue them to the FWC cover.stl. 

Note that both files are identical. 

In extras, print out the spidey_logo_disks. Note you will need to use a .25m nozzle for the details to resolve well. Enabling thin line detection in your slic3r produces ok results for a .4mm nozzle.
The disk to the left in the stl file goes to the left side of the FWC. 

** Barrels
There's several barrels which can be printed out to serve as an orange tip.
Both require some supports on the build plate.
Attaching them is fairly straight forward, just use some M3 screws in the 4 holes, 2 in the hop up insert, 2 in the FWC itself.


*** M3 Length:
- Bottom two FWC holes: 6mm to the nut, 7mm of extra space, 2mm nut thickness. With a 3mm thick mount plate on the barrel, that means any screw in the range of M3x11-> M3x18 would work, so M3x12 or M3x16 ought be good for that.
- Top two Hop up insert holes: Just 2mm to the nut, 2mm nut thickness, and 4mm extra space. With a 3mm thick mount plate on the barrel, that means any screw in the range of M3x7-> M3x11 would work. An M3x8 ought be perfect then, or an M3x10.
  
** Undergrip flashlight mount
Contains zip tie channels to easily attach a flashlight to the bottom of the handle.

*** M3 Length:
Uses 2x M3 screws going into the handle. 
- Towards stock rear one: 8mm to nut, 2mm nut thickness, 13mm extra: Needs an M3x10 -> M3x23
 - With 3mm flashlight mount thickness, needs an M3x13 -> M3x26. 
- Towards FWC front one:  15mm to nut, 2mm nut thickness, 6mm extra: Needs an M3x17 -> M3x23
 - With 3mm flashlight mount thickness, needs an M3x20 -> M3x26. 
   
Therefore a pair of M3x20, or M3x25 screws should be ideal.



** Drilling out holes

I decided not to drill out holes this time.
Mainly as I realized that drilling out holes with a square nut insert could easily leave some debris in the insert channel and make life much more difficult.
With the diameter I used for the holes (3.2mm), I found drilling mostly unneeded, so decided to just not drill any holes, with the below exceptions 

*** FWC
- Drill out the holes for the flywheel motors with a 3 mm bit.
  [[./fwc_step_0.jpg]]
  [[./fwc_step_0_1.png]]
*** Flywheels
- Drill out the center hole with a 13/64 drill bit.
  [[./fw_step_0_0.jpg]]
  [[./fw_step_0_1.jpg]]
  
** Nuts
Get your hex nuts and square nuts ready, as now comes the +painful+ fun part.
There's two main types of nut inserts we are using here (aside from the captive nuts inserted during the print phase).

*Inserting square nuts*: Get a flat head and just press them in. They friction fit into place quite nicely. 
[[./square_nut_flathead.jpg]]

*Screw Pulling Technique (AKA, inserting hex nuts)*: Borrowing from PRUSA, most of the hex nuts will be inserted with this method. See 
https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/1-introduction_54032 for a guide to screw pulling nuts.



* Step 1: Flywheel Cage Assembly
Remember to have drilled out the flywheel center hole (13/64 bit), and flywheel motor mount holes (3mm bit) before starting this.

** Step 1.1: Inserting the nuts
6 square nuts, 2 hex nuts need to be inserted.
The hex nut inserts are in the front of the cage, directly adjacent to the front square nut inserts by the barrel exit. 
Use the screw pulling technique here.
[[./fwc_assembly_1_1.jpg]]

** Step 1.2: Attaching the motors to the flywheels.
Solder 2MM Bullet connectors onto the flywheel motor leads.
[[./motor_bullet_connectors.jpg]]
Pay attention to the flywheel motor mount interference tabs. 
[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_0.png]]

They line up with the indents in the motor. 

[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_1.png]]

Insert the motor, ensuring that it is nearly flat with the flywheel bottom. A bit less than a mm will stick up. If the tabs aren't aligned, rotate and try again.
Avoid putting force on the motor endbell.
[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_3.jpg]]

Remembering to avoid putting force on the motor endbell, add the nyloc top nut which came with the motor, and torque down.
A 5/16 ratchet wrench worked perfectly for me.
[[./fwc_assembly_1_2_3.jpg]]

Repeat for the remaining flywheel.

** Step 1.3: Insert the flywheels into the cage.
Prepare 8 M3x8 screws.

Place the wire leads from the motors though the raceway in the fwc channel. 
[[./fwc_assembly_1_3_0.jpg]]

Insert the flywheel into the cage. 
[[./fwc_assembly_1_3_1.jpg]]

Use 4 M3x8 screws to tighten the motor to the cage. Screw said screws in diagonal pairs.

Repeat for the other wheel. 

** Finished Result

[[./fwc_assembly_finished.jpg]]

Ensure both wheels spin freely with minimal if any interference.

If interference occurs, lightly sand away the source. 

In my case, the groove fillers and wheels printed cleanly enough that there was barely any interference, and I did not need to sand. 

A good test is if the wheels can be spun freely and actually spin, instead of getting caught before completely a full rotation.

* Step 2: Assembling the feedneck core
** Step 2.1: Sand the inside of the feedneck.
Get rid of any bridging artifacts.
[[./2_1_sanding_bridge.jpg]]



** Step 2.2: Insert the hex nuts into the 8 holes.

These are too deep to screw pull, so instead I'd advise
- Using a longish screw to wedge the nut a bit into the hole.
[[./2_2_0.jpg]]
- Using a larger hex driver + hammer to force it all the way down.
[[./2_2_2.jpg]]
- Then screw pulling from the top.
[[./2_2_1.jpg]]

But wait there's more!

There's two more hex nut inserts hiding in the back!
Make sure to nab them too!
[[./2_2_3.png]]

** Step 2.3: Insert the roller bearing

Get a  bearing (MR63ZZ). 

Insert the bearing into the bearing hole.
[[./2_3_0.jpg]]

Use the same technique as screw pulling a hex nut to pull the bearing into place. Note that you will need a hex nut and a pair of pliers to hold the hex nut for this to work. 
Do not overtighten the screw, you can damage the bearing.
[[./2_3_1.jpg]]

** Step 2.4: Insert the roller.
Get an M3x14 screw.
Insert the roller into the roller area, making sure the nub sticking up fits into the other side of the bearing cavity.
[[./2_4_0.jpg]]
Proceed to insert the M3x14 screw through the bearing, and into the roller.
Tighten down, but again, do not overtighten. 
[[./2_4_1.png]]

Once snug, back off 1/2 turn.
The roller should be able to spin fairly free with a good flick. 

** Step 2.5: The cycle switch.
 Get a Cherry DC1 ready, and cut the arm down to 10mm.
[[./2_5_0.jpg]]

Get a pair of M2x20 screws ready. 

Drop the screws into the feedneck, as shown.
[[./2_5_1.jpg]]
Tighten them until they just start poking into the switch area. 

[[./2_5_2.jpg]]

Feed the switch wires through the raceway as shown, and then position the cycle switch into it's slow.  Ensure the button on the switch is towards the hopper side, and not towards you.

Tighten the M2x20 screws until snug, do not overtighten and strip.

End result should look like
[[./2_5_3.jpg]]

Oh, then go ahead and use something (like a flathead screwdriver) to push the switch wiring through one of the raceways, and into the ESC comppartment.
[[./2_8_0.jpg]]
** Step 2.6: Nut inserts
Insert 3 square nuts into the feed neck.
[[./2_6_0.png]]
The one in the ESC housing is a PITA to get to, I used a screwdriver to slide it along the wall until it was over the slow, and a second screwdriver to get it in.

** Step 2.7: Attach the pusher/roller motor

Get the 530 RPM 37D gearmotor. 

Line up it's D shaft with the D shaft of the oller, and then press fit them.
Support the roller, and motor can while doing so. 
[[./2_7_0.jpg]]

Get an M3x6, and using a ball driver, screw the motor in. 
[[./2_7_1.jpg]]


Get some 18AWG wire, and fish it through the spinner motor cover.
[[./2_7_2.jpg]]

Proceed to then solder those wires onto the roller motor.

[[./2_7_3.jpg]]

Then fish the other end of the wires through the ESC compartment.

[[./2_7_4.jpg]]
Proceed to snap fit the motor cover onto the roller motor.
[[./2_7_5.jpg]]


Get a M3x55 screw.
Screw the motor cover to the feedneck, making sure to pull any slacking wire through as you do so.
[[./2_7_6.jpg]]


The end result should look like
[[./2_7_7.jpg]]



* Step 3: Connect the FWC Cover to the FWC
Get a pair of M3x25mm screws.

Insert them into the indicated spots 
[[./3_0_0.png]]

Tighten down.

* Step 4: Combine the FWC and Feedneck
Screw in M3x35mm screws just until they start exiting the front of the feedneck through these holes.
[[./4_0_0.png]]
[[./screws_peaking.jpg]]

Get 4 M3x35mm screws. 
Insert the flywheel motor wires into the feedneck raceway.

[[4_0_1.jpg]]

Continue to pull them taught until the FWC and feedneck are touching. 
[[4_0_2.jpg]]

Now from the back of the feedneck, use the M3x35mm screws to connect the two pieces.

Ensure no flywheel motor wires are pinched. 

[[./4_0_3.png]]

Repeat for the FWC cover, with a pair of M3x12 screws.
[[./4_0_4.jpg]]


* Step 5: Grip Assembly
** Step 5.1: The trigger.
Get a screw with ~20mm of unthreaded rod, and a total length of 28mm.

Using the M3 bit, drill out the trigger.

[[./5_1_0.jpg]]

Slide the trigger into the grip assembly, and then screw it into place.

[[./5_1_1.jpg]]

** Step 5.2: Nut inserts
(Note I did this after installing the switch, which was a mistake).

[[./5_2_0.png]]

Insert the two square nuts into the insert channel, and push them into place.
You can verify they are seated by simply looking down the screw hole.

Note there's also 4 holes for a pair of zip tie channels for wire management. Those wound up being an unused artifact in this build.
If you wanted to run wires along the entire grip, they would be useful to ensure said wires steer clear of the trigger.

Two more insert square nuts are needed.
[[./5_2_1.jpg]]

The final two insert square nuts.
[[./5_2_2.jpg]]

But wait there's more!

There's a hex nut that needs to be pulled into place too.
[[./5_2_3.png]]

[[./5_2_4.jpg]]


** Step 5.3: Install the trigger switch
You will need a pair of M2x15 screws for this.
This is simple enough. Put the wires though the top. 
Line the switch up, adjusting until you are happy with the trigger pull.
Insert M2 nuts on the other side, and then screw down into position.

[[./5_3_0.jpg]]
[[./5_3_1.jpg]]

Give the trigger some test pulls, and adjust if desired.

** Step 5.4: Install the trigger guard

[[./5_4_0.jpg]]

Prepare an M3x20 screw, and a M3x8 screw.
Line the trigger guard up, and screw it into the top of the grip plate first. 
Use the M3x20 to screw the trigger guard to the grip plate, into the hex nut that was inserted earlier. 

See item 1. on the screenshot.

Then insert the M3x8 screw into the trigger switch cavity, and gently screw it in. This serves more as an alignment peg than a screw, so don't expect it to be tight.

[[./5_4_1.png]]

** Step 5.5: Install the side grip panels

Almost done with the grip!

Get 4 M3x12 screws ready.

Place the side panels on the blaster, and use those screws to screw both side panels into place.

[[./5_5_0.jpg]]

Pretty simple, and you've now got a fun clicky trigger grip to play with!



* Step 6: Stock preparation:

** Step 6.1: The main power switch wiring
Let's take a break from the core of the blaster for a bit and work on the stock now.

First, test fit the power switch into your outer stock piece.

Note the orientation, the switch guard is designed to guard against accidentally flipping off more than accidentally turning on.

[[./6_1_0.jpg]]

Get some 14 AWG wiring, and cut two wires. I cut lengths of 16 inches, which is overkill, but silicone stranded wire is cheap, and time is expensive. And it's much easier to get a wire down to size than to try to add more length to it. 

[[./6_1_1.jpg]]
[[./6_1_2.jpg]]

** Step 6.2: Nut inserts
Lets get some insert nuts out of the way.

There's 3 nuts that need to be inserted into the inner stock. 
Two square, one hex.
Press the square in, screw pull the hex, done.
[[./6_2_0.jpg]]
[[./6_2_1.jpg]]

** Step 6.3: Brass Tube (optional)
Get a 7/32" (~5.5mm) OD brass tube like  [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FZS231Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1][brass tubing]].
It needs to be at least 166 mm long.

Most likely it will be longer, so cut it down to 166mm. Aim for as close as possible, a mm or two under is fine. 

Use a dremel with a zip disk for this, remember to wear eye protection!
[[./6_3_0.jpg]]


Put the brass tube into the outer stock piece, in the hole near the switch cutout.

** Step 6.4: Inserting the main power switch
I'd advise getting a cutter and removing [[./6_4_0.png]], the clearance with it in is a bit too tight.

Slide the switch in, being mindful of orientation.

You should wind up with something like (including the brass tube from the earlier step).
[[./6_4_1.jpg]]
[[./6_4_2.jpg]]

** Step 6.5: Putting the two pieces together
Get a M3x8 screw, and a pair of M3x12 screws. 

Look at the back of the outer stock, and note the 3 screw holes.
Note that one hole is for the battery compartment lid screw, so ignore that.

See screenshot.
[[./6_5_0.png]]
Holes 1/2 are the square nut inserts and each take the M3x12 screws, hole 3 takes the M3x8 screw.

Slip the wiring through the raceway in the inner stock, being careful not to break it, as the top layers aren't that thick/strong. 
If broken, not the end of the world, just a bit less wire management available in the stock.
14AWG is a bit tighter than I'd like to get through the raceway, you can brace your finger against it while pulling to relieve strain, while feeding from below.
You can also always just glue the wires down instead once down.

[[./6_5_1.jpg]]

Anyway, feed the wires through, and when just a bit of slack is left, put the excess in the gap created in step 6.4.

The brass tube goes into a hole in the inner stock, so make sure to align that up while doing this to (if using one!).

The inner and outer stock should nicely line up. Then screw them together.
[[./6_5_2.jpg]]


* Step 7: Assembly the PCB and blaster logic board.
Man, having a PCB makes this nice and self documenting. 
[[./7_0_0.png]]


[[https://oshwlab.com/mbregg/nerf-brushed-pusher-brushless-flywheel-board_copy_copy][EasyEda Link, the two relevant files are TB67H420FTG and PCB_2020-11-28_19-54-00]].
The PCB gerber file is available in the /PCB at the root of this repo.
 should be fairly straight forward. 
The components on the PCB are a 
- Arduino Pro mini, flashed firmware from /rival_hopper.ino/rival_hopper.ino.ino.  I should fix that naming at some point.
  - A tutorial on programming arduinos, especially the pro mini is out of scope for this, but there's many excellent ones online such as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78HCgaYsA70][this one]].
- A voltage regulator, [[https://www.pololu.com/product/2843][D24V5F5]]. The square pad is BATT _VBUS, the pin to the right of it is GND, and the right most pin is 5V out.
- TWO TB67H420FTG motor driver on [[https://www.pololu.com/product/2999][pololu carrier]].
  
Solder male headers onto the Arduino, and the two motor driver boards, and the D24V5F5 regulator.

Solder resistors, and capacitors onto the PCB, following the values written on the PCB itself.

Ignore the resistors labeled VREF, that's for playing around with setting current chopping.

Solder female headers onto the PCB itself, for the pro mini, and for the two motor driver boards, and the voltage regulator.

Solder female headers onto the PCB for the two limit switches.

Solder male headers onto the PCB for the ESC connectors.

See the batt leads connector. The circular pad goes to batt V_BUS, the square pad to GND.

Don't forget a big electrolytic low ESC capacitor next to it!
It's overkill, but I like using [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073YP95G1/ref][ Panasonic FM Series Capacitors 50V 220uf]].

Solder a connector to that, I used an xt30.

For both of the motor drivers, solder B-/B+ and A-/A+ together, and attach leads with a connector. I used micro deans for this.

Note that the spinner motor, in the hopper, connects to the driver board at the far end of the PCB, while the pusher motor connects to the motor driver board closer to the arduino, in the middle of the PCB.

You should be good to go.

If you'd rather implement this on a perf board or something, I'd advise looking at the arduino sketch, the pins are all documented.





* Step 8: Wiring the feed neck up.

** Step 8.0: Prep
Get your other 37D gear motor, the 150 RPM one ready.
[[./8_0_0.jpg]]

Now prepare to make a wire splice that looks sorta like this
[[./8_0_1.jpg]]

Let's go over real quickly whats on here:
- 16AWG: One male 3.5mm bullet plug pair, which connects to the battery. This will connect to the wiring harness in the stock we'll make later.
- 16 AWG: Two female 3.5mm bullet plug pairs, which connect to each ESC.
- 18 AWG: One XT30 connector, which goes to power the blaster controller board. (Do not solder this onto yet, it won't fit through the raceways!

This, to prepare this, I'd advise
- Get 2 lengths 1.5 feet 18 AWG, one red one black.
- Get 4 lengths of 13CM 16 AWG,  one red one black.
- Get 2 lengths 3-4cm 16 AWG.,  one red one black.
  
Connect the male bullets to the short lengths, and then to the other side of each short length connect 2 (one color each!) of the 13 CM 16 AWG leads, and 1 of the 1.5 feet 18 AWG leads.

Solder female bullet connectors onto the other ends of the 13CM leads. 

Do not yet solder the xt30 connector onto the 1.5 foot lead. 

** Step 8.1; Routing the wires
Flip the feedneck over, and look at the big hole in the center.
Now take this mess of wires, and to each ESC chamber, send a red, and black 16 AWG wire with a female 3.5mm bullet plug on it.
Pick one of the chambers and send the 18 AWG power leads too. 
Route the male 3.5mm bullet plugs out the back.
You should get something looking like this.
[[./8_1_0.jpg]]

Go ahead and route the main power leads, cycle switch (in the ESC chamber from earlier), and roller motor wires (in the ESC chamber from earlier) into the controller compartment. 
Now you can terminate those wires with the appropriate connectors.
I used XT30 and 3 pin male headers, and deans micro T respectively.
[[./8_1_1.jpg]]

** Step 8.2: Testing time
This is a good chance to test. Get your ESCs, and hook them up to the female 3.5mm bullets in the ESC compartment.
Hook them up to the to the 2 mm motor leads too.

Now wire that mess up to the PCB board.
- Hook up the cycle switch (orientation doesn't really matter yet). 
- Hook up the trigger, or any 3 pin switch if you don't want the awkwardness of a tethered grip.
- Hook up the ESC 3 pin headers.
- Hook up the controller board power.
- Hook up the roller motor.
- Don't worry about the spinner in the hopper yet, it can be ignored.
  
Time to plug in. You can either plug the 3.5mm bullet connectors directly into the battery plug, or solder up an XT60 connector that terminates to a pair of bullets real quick.

*Generally I advise to use something other than a unprotected lithium pack for testing an unproven circuit, especially if just plugging bullet connectors right into an XT60 connector. I ran two 7.2V NiMH packs in series, for a 12S NIMH pack. You could also probably get away with a fused/protected lithium pack too.*
  
*** Initial Boot check

Boot up, and verify you get no errors. If errors occur, troubleshoot.
Be sure to try flipping the trigger plug as the first step in trouble shooting!
Assuming you are error free, mark the trigger header so you know which orientation is correct.

*** Flywheel rotation check
Now check that the flywheels rotate in the correct direction.
If not, flip a pair of leads and repeat.
Now manually feed balls into the feed neck and verify they fire as expected.

*** Pusher direction check
If the pusher goes in reverse, you can either cut and flip the leads, or in software, find the line that says 

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
constexpr bool reverse_pusher = ...;
#+END_SRC
and flip that boolean!

*** Cycle switch check

One you can feed balls, check the cycle switch.
With the feed neck completely empty, drop one ball in.
Tapping the trigger should fire said ball, and not merely place it directly above the limit switch.
You can fit at least two balls at once into the feed neck.
Do so, and tap the trigger.
One ball should fire, and the remaining ball should be stuck exactly over the cycle switch.
Reverse the limit switch connector if this isn't so.
Mark the correct orientation here too.


*** Finishing up
Remove the PCB from the blaster, making sure to have marked the trigger and cycle switch orientations (or being willing to redo that process!). 

Leave the ESCs hanging and connected, we don't want to lose the correct flywheel rotation, and we are going to pack them into the chamber in a moment, where it will be more annoying to flip leads.

** Step 8.3: The spinner motor
Wire 24 AWG, 2 feet leads onto the spinner motor from earlier.
Drop the spinner motor into place. 
[[./8_3_0.jpg]]
Fish it's leads through the feed neck, and into the controller chamber like the other wires.

Cut the leads down to length, and solder a connector on. 

The spinner will sit on a shelf and won't go down, but will happily fall out, so be careful about flipping the blaster over from this point on.

** Step 8.4: The trigger wire

Without flipping the feed neck upside down (laying it on it's side is fine), fish the trigger wires from the grip through the center hole in the feed neck, and into an ESC chamber, and then into the controller housing, just like the other wires.

Feed this wire through so the feed neck and grip have just an inch of slack or so. 

* Step 9: Connecting the grip and feedneck
Get 4 M3x12 screws.

Without flipping the feedneck upside down, line it up over the grip, and screw them together into holes 1,2,3,4.


Get a M3x8 screw.
In the remaining screw hole in the grip plate (#5 in the screenshot), in the FWC area in front of the trigger guard, insert this screw and tighten up.

[[./9_0_0.png]]


The end result should look something like this
[[./9_0_2.jpg]]


Finally, gently push the ESCs and wires into the chambers, so that they are fully enclosed in the feedneck.  It should look like this
[[./9_0_3.jpg]]

This is a good time to do another test, this time adding in the hopper spinner motor.
[[./9_0_4.jpg]]


Almost done!




* Step 10: Controller compartment lid nuts
Before I forget, make sure to insert square nuts for the lid.

[[./10_0_0.jpg]]
[[./10_0_1.png]]


* Step 11: Hop up time
Get this piece.
[[./11_0_0.jpg]]

Square nut inserts
[[./11_0_1.jpg]]

These fall out easy, advise using M3x4 screws to keep in place

[[./11_0_2.jpg]]

Insert a M3 nyloc hex nut, and then on a hard service press in.
You an help with a hammer here, just don't smash the piece into oblivion.
You can also use something like an M3x4 partly in the nyloc nut to help it get in as far as possible. 


[[./11_0_3.jpg]]
[[./11_0_4.jpg]]

Get these insert nuts too.
[[./11_0_5.jpg]]

Using an exacto knife/M3 drill bit, carefully clear out these sacrificial layers.
If you use the M3 drill bit in a powered drill, be VERY careful here.

Use a pair of M3x16 screws to screw the hop up piece in from the top.

Now get a M3x20 screw, and insert it into the barrel and into the nyloc nut in the insert.

Use the hole in the bottom of the FWC to get in there and tighten that nut up.
[[./11_0_6.jpg]]

Tighten it fairly far, ~3.8 mm of the screw (including screw head) poking out is reasonable.

You should have something looking like this
[[./11_0_7.jpg]]



* Step 12: The controller lid
If the blaster control board is not in and properly connected, connect it, and insert it into the controller compartment.
Get 4 M3x10 screws, and making sure not to pinch any wires, attach the lid to the FWC cover.

* Step 13: The stock Wiring
** Step 13.1: The xt60 connector
Fit your pack, and then cut the lead from the switch to an appropriate length. 
[[./13_1_0.jpg]]

Repeat with the other lead, leaving about 72mm of slack coming out the back, while still having enough wire in the case so that you xt60 connector can be located where you want it with the pack in.

Excuse the horribly bad picture, my camera decided to enter blur city for this section so pictures will be a bit sparse.

[[./13_1_1.jpg]]

Now solder up a male xt60 connector inside the battery compartment.

Solder up female 3.5mm bullet connectors onto the leads leaving the battery compartment.

** Step 13.2: The stock mounter

*** 13.2.0: Nut insert time!
We've got a lot!

We've got 3 square nuts, and 3 hex nuts on the back
[[./13_2_0.jpg]]

And another secret square nut on the bottom here
[[./13_2_1.jpg]]

*** 13.2.1: The sling mount
Get a M3x35 screw with ~30mm of smooth shaft. 

Screw that into the side to form the sling mount. 

[[./13_2_2.jpg]]

*** 13.2.2: Feeding the wire
Excuse the blur again, but feed the battery leads through the stock mounter hole.
[[./13_2_3.jpg]]

** Step 13.3: Mounting the stock mounter
Get the male 3.5mm bullets leaving the feed neck, and hook them up to the battery compartment leads, through the stock mount.
Now bring the stock mount to the feed neck, letting the excess wire go into the channel in the rear of the feedneck

[[./13_3_1.png]]

The end result should look like 
[[./13_3_0.jpg]]


Get a M3x16 screw.
From the bottom, screw in said M3x16 screw to secure the stock mounter. 
[[./13_3_4.png]]
Get a pair of M3x20 screws.
Now get the two side sockets, the ones facing the feedneck without an insert nut.
[[13_3_5.png]]

Get a M3x16 screw.
Bring the stock up to the stock mounter, pulling excess wire into the battery compartment.
Use the M3x16 screw on the highlighted hole.
Don't tighten yet, but rid of most of the slack.
[[./13_3_2.png]]

Once that is loosely secured, place a pair of M3x12 screws into the two adjacent holes.
Use the holes in the battery compartment to screw these screws in. 
[[./13_3_3.jpg]]

Now tighten all three screws.

Congrats, the stock is mounted!!


* Step 14: The hopper!
[[./14_0_0.jpg]]
** Step 14.1: The lid
Prep 4 7.8mm diameter, and 3mm thick magnets.

Friction fit into hopper and lid, make sure they attract not repel!


[[./14_1_0.jpg]]
[[./14_1_1.jpg]]

Get your M3 drill bit again, and drill out the lid hinge. jo
[[./14_1_2.jpg]]

Oh, and screw pull a hex nut into the insert here
[[./14_1_3.png]]


Get a screw with a 30mm blank shaft, and cut it down to 38mm total.

Use that to attach the lid to the hopper.


[[./14_1_4.jpg]]

** Step 14.2: Prep the spinner

Hex nut insert, in the spinner
[[./14_2_0.jpg]]

Then get an M3x12 screw, and screw it into the spinner, just until it's poking into the d shaft in the center.

** Step 14.3: Attach the hopper
Prep 8 M3x16, and 4 M3x8 screws.

Spots 1-4 (the ones that go to the motor!) use the M3x8 screws, and the remaining 8 slots use the M3x16 screws.

[[./14_3_0.png]]

** Step 14.4: Attach the spinner

Align the D shaft so the flat of it is facing the rear of the blaster.
Slide the spinner onto the D shaft, and put your ball driver through the hole in the hopper to tighten it up.


[[./14_4_0.jpg]]

** Congrats, you're done!
[[./14_d.jpg]]

Err, except for the battery compartment lid, I'll get to that soon.

* Step 15: The battery lid
Get the lid out, and insert a square nut and nyloc hex nut into their respective spots on the battery cover lid.

Get an M3 thumbscrew ready.

[[./15_0_0.jpg]]

Use the dremel w/ zip disk to cut the M3 thumbscrew down to length, it should have about 5-5.5mm of threaded length.

Screw the thumbscrew into the nyloc nut inserted. This is the handle to open the battery cover with.

Now get an M3x12 screw.

[[./15_0_2.jpg]]

[[./15_0_3.jpg]]

And that's it! Screw the battery door shut.

To open, just remove that M3x12 screw and pull the handle!

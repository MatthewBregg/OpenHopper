STATUS: In progress. I am currently printing parts, and writing this guide live as I go.

* Printing Time
I advise printing in PETG for all parts, PLA is untested, although would probably be fine, most parts on this blaster are fairly thick.

Supports were avoided for the majority of the model, there's 1-2 places that do need supports, mainly 
- Both of the spinners.
  - Supports around the perimeter for these are very easy to remove, and not visible anyway, so extra residue can be ignored. See their section for more details.
- The sling mount on the stock mount.
  - This broke off very cleanly and easily with my pliers.

I advise using ironing for pretty much all parts, although it's purely optional/cosmetic.

For the most part, any reasonably strong infill/perim/solid combo will work, so feel free to diverge from the recommended if you so desire *EXCEPT* when I mention that a part needs to be extra solid/100% infill.

Assume .20mm layer height unless specified otherwise.

** The Hopper
*** File: Angled Hopper.stl
#+CAPTION: The angled hopper plated in the correct orientation.
[[./angled_hopper_plated.png]]

No supports.
Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

This is the main hopper that holds the balls. 
Plate as shown. This isn't a particularly load bearing part, and even in my prototype prints with 10% cubic infill, and only 2 perimeters, it feels fairly solid.
Nonetheless, no kill like overkill.

*** File: Plain Lid No speed loader.stl/New Lid with space for feed gate.stl
#+CAPTION: The lid plated in the correct orientation. Print one or the other.
[[./hopper_lids.png]]

No supports.
Ironing.
30% hex infill, 4 perims, *2* solids (might as well take advantage of that clear petg here!).
I used variable layer height for the retainer on the speed gate variation, but this is optional.

*** File: HopperToFlywheelTube.stl
The meat of the blaster.

This connects the hopper top, flywheel cage, stock, and grip assembly together.
This also houses the ESCs, both spinner motor mounts, and has most of the wire raceways.

*NOTE: Captive nuts, make sure to insert a print pause at the right point to catch em!*

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

20% gyroid infill, 4 perims/5 solids, for my own sanity in print times.

No supports needed.

*** File: Wings.stl
This serves as the hopper agitator.

Supports on build plate only, due to the nature of it they are easy to remove, and final surface doesn't matter too much, this part goes inside the hopper.

Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

[[./spinner_c.png]]

*** File: Spinner.stl

This serves the pusher, and feeds balls in the feed neck into the flywheels.

Supports on build plate only, due to the nature of it they are easy to remove, and final surface doesn't matter too much, as the support side isn't visible.
No Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

You'll need to insert a nyloc nut while printing this, so make sure to add a pause at 18.2m to do so. 
The dome side of the nyloc nut should be pointing down towards the build plate.

*** File: Spinner Motor Cover.stl

This acts as cover for the spinner in the feed neck, which otherwise would have it's motor terminals and endbell exposed.  It also doubles as a wire raceway for said motor wires.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing, no real point with this one, too many angled tops.

No supports needed.

** Stock
*** File: Stock Mounter.stl
This connects the feed neck, hopper, main grip plate to the stock.

We print this one at 100% infill due to this.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No ironing here.

Supports are needed for the sling mount, see the support image. They are minor, and easily break off even with petg with some simple pliers.

[[./stock_mounter_supports.png]]

*** File: Outer stock.stl

No supports, no ironing.

20% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

This is mostly cosmetic, but it does house the power switch.  

#+CAPTION: Orientation
[[./stock_outer.png]]

*** File: stock_inner.stl

No supports, no ironing.  4 perims/5 solids.

I used a height range modifier to set everything above 159mm to 100% infill, although this is optional. 

#+CAPTION: Height range modifier
[[./stock_inner_height_mod.png]]

This serves as the battery box, and connects the stock outer to the blaster.

Warning: Do not print over octoprint, slic3r generates lots of short lines/arcs, to the point where my printer started going at a snails pace and ruined the print. This might just be an issue for 8 bit printers, due to the speed of checksumming serial gcode commands.

*** File: lid.stl
TODO.


** The FWC
*** File: FWC.stl
The flywheel cage, the big spinny wheel mount. 

4 perims/5 solids, 100% rectilinear infill. 
Yes to ironing.  No supports.

100% infill to reduce noise and ensure there's no flex.

*** File: Flywheel.stl
The big spinny thing.

.1mm layer height.
20% infill, honeycomb. 
No supports/ironing.
3 shells, 6 tops/6 bottoms, seam position random.

Print out two of these!

*** FWC Cover.stl

This serves several purposes
- Reinforce the connection between the FWC and main blaster.
- Serve as a finger guard for the top of the flywheels.
- Contains the hop up mount. 
- Contains wire raceways and a compartment for the main blaster controller.
- The blaster controller compartment lid doubles as the top rail.

Despite this, printing it is fairly straight forward, and I don't feel the need to make this particularly strong (100% infill or more perimeters). 

Even if you slung the blaster primarily via the rail here, I wouldn't be too worried, although in that case I might beef up the print parameters. 

20% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.
No supports/ironing.

#+CAPTION: Orientation
[[./fwc_cover.png]]

*** Controller Compartment Lid With Rail.stl or Controller Compartment Lid.stl

30% honeycomb infill, 5 perims/4 solids.

This is the controller cover, and the picatinny rail. If you'd prefer not to have a picatinny rail, just print the plain cover instead. 

Supports no, ironing yes.

** Grip
*** File: Grip Sides.stl and Grip Sides(Mirror).stl
Side panels which go on the grip.
Covers the trigger wiring compartment, and improves ergonomics.

No supports, yes ironing.

25% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

#+CAPTION:Orientation

*** File: Trigger Grip Assembly

The main handle.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No supports, no ironing.

#+CAPTION:Orientation
[[./grip.png]]

*** File: Trigger.stl
It's the trigger.

100% rectilinear infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

No supports, yes. ironing.

#+CAPTION: Orientation
[[./trigger.png]]



*** File: Trigger Guard.stl

It's the guard for the trigger.

25% honeycomb infill, 4 perims/4 solids.

Supports on enforced area, see screenshot, yes. ironing.

You can also print this in .1mm layer height for a smoother curve. 
In that case, double the solids.

* Post Processing
** Cosmetic Gluing (Optional)
I'm not going to go into too much detail on this as these are purely optional cosmetic greebles. 
Print them out, ideally with a color change midway so they look nicer, and devcon them into the debossed areas in the FWC cover and the FWC. 

Print out the Orb Weaver Sign A and B, and glue them to the FWC cover.stl. 

Note that both files are identical. 

In extras, print out the spidey_logo_disks. Note you will need to use a .25m nozzle for the details to resolve well. Enabling thin line detection in your slic3r produces ok results for a .4mm nozzle.
The disk to the left in the stl file goes to the left side of the FWC. 

** Drilling out holes

I decided not to drill out holes this time.
Mainly as I realized that drilling out holes with a square nut insert could easily leave some debris in the insert channel and make life much more difficult.
With the diameter I used for the holes (3.2mm), I found drilling mostly unneeded, so decided to just not drill any holes, with the below exceptions 

*** FWC
- Drill out the holes for the flywheel motors. 
*** Flywheels
- Drill out the center hole with a 13/64 drill bit.
  
** Nuts
Get your hex nuts and square nuts ready, as now comes the +painful+ fun part.
There's two main types of nut inserts we are using here (aside from the captive nuts inserted during the print phase).

*Inserting square nuts*: Get a flat head and just press them in. They friction fit into place quite nicely. 

*Screw Pulling Technique (AKA, inserting hex nuts)*: Borrowing from PRUSA, most of the hex nuts will be inserted with this method. See 
https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/1-introduction_54032 for a guide to screw pulling nuts.

* Printing Time
I advise printing in PETG for all parts, PLA is untested, although would probably be fine, most parts on this blaster are fairly thick.

Supports were avoided for the majority of the model, there's 1-2 places that do need supports, mainly 
- Both of the spinners.
  - Supports around the perimeter for these are very easy to remove, and not visible anyway, so extra residue can be ignored. See their section for more details.
- The sling mount on the stock mount.
  - This broke off very cleanly and easily with my pliers.

I advise using ironing for pretty much all parts, although it's purely optional/cosmetic.

For the most part, any reasonably strong infill/perim/solid combo will work, so feel free to diverge from the recommended if you so desire *EXCEPT* when I mention that a part needs to be extra solid/100% infill.

** The Hopper

No supports.
Ironing.
25% hex infill, 4 perims/5 solids.

This is the main hopper that holds the balls. 
Plate as shown. This isn't a particularly load bearing part, and even in my prototype prints with 10% cubic infill, and only 2 perimeters, it feels fairly solid.
Nonetheless, no kill like overkill.
